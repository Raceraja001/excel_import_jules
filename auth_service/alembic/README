Generic single-database configuration.

This is the Alembic configuration file for the auth_service.

Key files:

- `alembic.ini`: Main configuration file. Sets the database URL (can be overridden by environment variables via `env.py`).
- `env.py`: Script that is run when `alembic` command is invoked. Configured for async SQLAlchemy. It imports your application's `Base` metadata and database settings.
- `script.py.mako`: Template for new migration scripts.
- `versions/`: Directory where migration scripts are stored.

Common commands:

- `alembic revision -m "create_some_table"`: Generate a new revision file.
- `alembic upgrade head`: Apply all migrations up to the latest.
- `alembic downgrade -1`: Revert the last applied migration.
- `alembic history`: Show migration history.
- `alembic current`: Show current revision.

Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set correctly and accessible when running these commands, as `env.py` is configured to use it via `app.config.settings`.
The `PYTHONPATH` should also be set to the root of the project or `prepend_sys_path = .` in `alembic.ini` should be working to find `app.config` and `app.models`.
We have used `sys.path.append` in `env.py` to help with module resolution.

Example command from `auth_service` root directory:
`DATABASE_URL="mysql+asyncmy://user:pass@host/db" alembic revision -m "create_initial_tables"`
`DATABASE_URL="mysql+asyncmy://user:pass@host/db" alembic upgrade head`

Alternatively, ensure `.env` is loaded or variables are exported in your shell.
