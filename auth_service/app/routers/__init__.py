# This file makes 'routers' a Python package.
# You might import individual router objects here if you want to
# aggregate them or make them available for inclusion in main.py.

# For example:
# from . import auth_router
# from . import user_router
# from . import tenant_router

# __all__ = ["auth_router", "user_router", "tenant_router"] # Example
