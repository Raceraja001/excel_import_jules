# This file makes 'app' a Python package.
# You can optionally put package-level imports or code here.

# Example: Make settings easily accessible (if desired)
# from .config import settings
# from .database import Base, engine, AsyncSessionFactory

# It's often kept empty or used for selective imports to define the package's public API.
# For now, keeping it simple.
